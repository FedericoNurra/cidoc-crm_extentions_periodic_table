# The enriched CIDOC-crm Periodic Table (modified at the INHA)
An interactive, dinamically generated interface for the documentation of the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model and its extentions.

You can try it [here](https://digital.inha.fr/cidoc/).

### Scope

The goal of this interface would be attained if it afforded an improved accessibility of the conceptual model. 

You can find complete information in the official Cidoc-CRM documentation. However, the difference between this interface and the documentation itself lays in the way in which information is presented to the user - namely, in a single web-page (instead of a long documentation), with interactivity, utilities, and visually useful features available.

### How

The interface content is dinamically generated from the Cidoc-CRM implementation in RDF.
There is no server-side computation, all the data processing and reasoning is done client side, entirely in javascript.
