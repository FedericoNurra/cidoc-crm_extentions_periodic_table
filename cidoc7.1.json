It is intended for an\nassumed majority of uses. Depending on the application, users may create adequate extensions \ncompatible with the logical definitions of the CIDOC CRM.\n\nCreated by FORTH-ICS Thursday November 25, 2021\nCC BY 4.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode\n\nEncoding Rules:\n1. The RDF spelling rules do not allow blanks. Hence we have replaced them by underscores.\n   For instance \"E63_Beginning_of_Existence\" or \"P2i_is_type_of\".\n\n2. RDF does not allow to instantiate properties beginning from a range value.\n   Therefore, each CRM property is represented as two RDFS properties.\n   For instance \"P2 has type (is type of)\" is represented as:\n   \"P2_has_type\" for the domain to range direction and \"P2i_is_type_of\" for the range to domain direction.\n\n3. The primitive values \"E60 Number\", \"E61 Time Primitive\", \"E62 String\", \"E94 Space Primitive\" and \n   \"E95 Spacetime Primitive\" referred in the Model for formal completeness are interpreted as rdfs:literal.\n\n4. RDF does not support properties of properties, therefore, users may create their own\n   subProperties for CRM properties that have a type property such as \"P3 has note\":\n   Instead of P3 has note (P3-1 has type : parts description) declare\n   <rdf:Property rdf:about=\"P3_parts_description\">\n      <rdfs:domain rdf:resource=\"E1_CRM_Entity\"/>\n      <rdfs:range rdf:resource=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Literal\"/>\n      <rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource=\"P3_has_note\"/>\n   </rdf:Property>\n\n5. Scope notes are represented as <rdfs:comment> elements.\n\n6. In addition this encoding contains labels in languages different from English, \n   which are taken from translations of previous versions of the CIDOC CRM.    \n\n7. Any other differences in labels, scope notes  and semantic relationships of this encoding \n   to the authoritative definition of the CIDOC CRM v.7.1.1 (May 2021) are not intended transfer errors. \n   FORTH appreciates your feed-back on such errors.\n\n8. CRM time extension 1.0 Encoded in RDFS (http://old.cidoc-crm.org/docs/How_to%20implement%20CRM_Time_in%20RDF.pdf)\n   Since the Time Primitive of the CRM can not directly be implemented in RDF Triple Stores, we define in this extension\n   of 4 properties replacing P81 and P82 adequately using xsd:dateTime. \n   Property P81 is dedicated for modeling the Time-Span's maximum known temporal extent i.e. ongoing_throughout. \n   Property P82 is for modeling the minimum outer bounds of events i.e. at_some_time_within. \n   P81 has its time interval redefined by P81a and P81b. Similarly, we redefine P82 by P82a and P82b.\n\n",
      "#comment1": "\n## RDFS Generation Policies\n\n### Sources\n\nPolicies followed for the RDFS implementation of CIDOC v.7.1.1 were created w.r.t.:\n\n- Implementing the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model in RDF (http://www.cidoc-crm.org/Resources/implementing-the-cidoc-conceptual-reference-model-in-rdf)\n- How to implement CRM Time in RDF (http://old.cidoc-crm.org/docs/How_to%20implement%20CRM_Time_in%20RDF.pdf)\n- CIDOC-CRM SIG feedback and the general guidelines:\n  - Each property is declared twice, forward and backwards, unless no inverse name is defined in parentheses, or domain or range is interpreted as literal\n  - All Primitive Values become rdfs:Literal\n  - All IsA declarations from/to and between Primitive values are ignored\n\n### Policies\n\n#### **A. CIDOC Classes implementation in RDFS**\n\nThe CIDOC-CRM model defines classes, that in Triple Stores are typically implemented as primitive values. These classes are all subclasses of `E59 Primitive` and in RDFS they are interpreted as Literal. There are some classes in the CIDOC-CRM model that are both subclasses of `E59 Primitive` and E41 Appellation. So far we have followed the decision by CRM-SIG in \"Issue 394: Solution for Dualism of E41 Appellation and rdfs:label\" in 28-11-2018 wrt the question whether these classes should be implemented as rdfs:Class or still be interpreted as rdfs:Literal.\n\nIn this version we have followed the following policy regarding CIDOC Classes implementation in RDFS:\n\n> A1. CIDOC Classes that are subClasses of `E59 Primitive` are interpreted as rdfs:Literal regardless of whether they are also subClasses of another Class.\n\nAs a result, the following CIDOC classes were not defined in RDFS:\n\n- `E59 Primitive`\n- `E60 Number`\n- `E61 Time Primitive`\n- `E62 String`\n- `E94 Space Primitive`\n- `E95 Spacetime Primitive`\n\nAdditionally, the following isA relationships were not defined in RDFS:\n\n- `E59 Primitive` subClassOf `E1 CRM Entity`\n- `E60 Number` subClassOf `E59 Primitive`\n- `E61 Time Primitive` subClassOf `E59 Primitive`, `E41 Appellation`\n- `E62 String` subClassOf `E59 Primitive`\n- `E94 Space Primitive` subClassOf `E59 Primitive`, `E41 Appellation`\n- `E95 Spacetime Primitive` subClassOf `E59 Primitive`, `E41 Appellation`\n\n#### **B. CIDOC Properties implementation in RDFS**\n\nThe decisions in policy A affect the implementation of CIDOC Properties in RDFS. A property cannot define an rdfs:Literal as rdfs:domain, and the backwards direction of a property with an rdfs:Literal as rdfs:range cannot be created for the exact same reason.\n\nFurther, the property ranges defined as rdfs:Literal in this implementation do not inherit the properties of the superclasses defined in the CIDOC Model. A separate guideline will describe how to instantiate such properties if at all needed.\n\nAnother aspect considered for the implementation of properties in RDFS is whether a distinct inverse property definition should be provided.\n\nIn this version we followed the following policies regarding CIDOC Properties implementation in RDFS:\n\n> B1. CIDOC Property backwards/inverse direction is **not** defined, whenever no inverse name for the property has been specified in parentheses in the official CIDOC documentation and property domain is not equal with property range.\n\nAs a result, the following properties do not define an inverse direction.\n\n- `E1 CRM Entity. P3 has note: E62 String`\n- `E19 Physical Object. P57 has number of parts: E60 Number`\n- `E52 Time-Span. P79 beginning is qualified by: E62 String`\n- `E52 Time-Span. P80 end is qualified by: E62 String`\n- `E52 Time-Span. P81 ongoing throughout: E61 Time Primitive`\n- `E52 Time-Span. P82 at some time within: E61 Time Primitive`\n- `E54 Dimension. P90 has value: E60 Number`\n- `E53 Place. P171 at some place within: E94 Space Primitive`\n- `E53 Place. P172 contains: E94 Space Primitive`\n- `E90 Symbolic Object. P190 has symbolic content: E62 String`\n\n> B2. CIDOC Property forward direction is **not** defined whenever property domain is interpreted as rdfs:Literal (A.1). Similarly, CIDOC Property backwards/inverse direction is **not** defined, whenever property range is interpreted as rdfs:Literal (A.1). Further, the instances of classes interpreted as rdfs:Literal, cannot express in RDFs their **inherited** properties that could be expressed according to CIDOC Model.\n\nAs a result,\n\na) The following **direct forward direction** CIDOC Properties **cannot** be expressed and are **not defined** in RDFS:\n\n- `E95 Spacetime Primitive. P169 defines spacetime volume (spacetime volume is defined by): E92 Spacetime Volume`\n- `E61 Time Primitive. P170 defines time (time is defined by): E52 Time-Span`\n\nb) The following **direct backwards direction** CIDOC Properties **cannot** be expressed and are **not defined** in RDFS:\n\n- `E94 Space Primitive. P168i defines place (place is defined by): E53 Place`\n\n> B3. Whenever no backwards/inverse property name is specified and property domain matches with property range, then the forward/direct property direction should be used for **both** directions and **no backwards/inverse property** needs to be defined.\n\nAs a result, we did not implement a separate backwards/inverse direction for the following CIDOC Properties:\n\n- `E53 Place. P121 overlaps with: E53 Place`\n- `E53 Place. P122 borders with: E53 Place`\n- `E92 Spacetime Volume. P132 spatiotemporally overlaps with: E92 Spacetime Volume`\n- `E92 Spacetime Volume. P133 is spatiotemporally separated from: E92 Spacetime Volume`\n- `E41 Appellation. P139 has alternative form: E41 Appellation`\n\nAdditionally, all aforementioned redundant backwards/inverse CIDOC Property direction references, are replaced by the respective direct/forward CIDOC Property direction.\n\n- The hierarchical link of  `P10i` subPropertyOf `P132i` was replaced with `P10i` subPropertyOf `P132`.\n\n#### **C. Labels and appellations**\n\nCIDOC-CRM version 7.1.1 defines the below subpropertyOf relations:\n\n- `P168 place is defined by` **subPropertyOf** `P1 is identified by`\n- `P169i spacetime volume is defined by` **subPropertyOf** `P1 is identified by`\n- `P170i time is defined by` **subPropertyOf** `P1 is identified by`\n\nThe range of P168, 169i and P170i is `E94 Space Primitive`, `E95 Spacetime Primitive` and `E61 Time Primitive` respectively, which are all subclasses of `E41 Appellation` and interpreted as `rdfs:Literal` in RDFS, i.e. these three properties are datatype properties. However, the P1 property has range E41 Appellation, i.e. this property is an object property. Since OWL 2 distinguishes between object subproperties (https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-syntax-20121211/#Object_Subproperties), data subproperties (https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-syntax-20121211/#Data_Subproperties) and annotation subproperties (https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-syntax-20121211/#Annotation_Subproperties), and also in OWL-DL the subject and object of a subproperty statement must be either both datatype properties or both object properties (see here (https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#subPropertyOf-def)), we do not include these three subPropertyOf relations in the provided RDFS implementation to avoid inconsistencies when reasoning with OWL 2 and OWL DL. Instead, we provide them in a separate \u2018supplementary\u2019 RDFS file which one can use if such inconsistencies are not expected.\n\nIn addition, since in the current practice, the property `rdfs:label` is widely used to denote appellations (see CRM-SIG Issue 394 (http://cidoc-crm.org/Issue/ID-394-solution-for-dualism-of-e41-appellation-and-rdfslabel)), the following `subPropertyOf` relation was also included in the supplementary RDFS file:\n\n- `rdfs:label` subPropertyOf `P1 is identified by`\n\nNote that according to the RDF Schema 1.1 specification, the domain (or range) of a property does not necessarily need to be 'subClassOf' or 'equal' to the domain (or range) of its superproperties. By including this subproperty relation, one can either directly use `rdfs:label` for providing a non-URI identifier/appellation for an instance of `E1 CRM Entity`, or use `P1 is identified by` for associating an additional URI-identifier with an instance of `E1 CRM Entity`, or use `P1 is identified by` and create an intermediate node (i.e. a URI-identifier for instance of `E41_Appellation`) for providing more detailed information about this appellation.\n\n#### **D. Implementing Value Intervals**\n\nThe following are property pairs needed to simulate the interval-valued primitive values foreseen by the CRM:\n\n> D1. addition of two new properties, defined as subproperties of `E52 Time-Span. P81 ongoing throughout: E61 Time Primitive`, for the 'maximum known temporal extent' boundaries specification of `E61 Time Primitive`.\n\nAs a result, we have created the following property definitions:\n\n- `E52 Time-Span. P81a end of the begin: rdfs:Literal` (subPropertyOf `E52 Time-Span. P81 ongoing throughout: E61 Time Primitive`)\n- `E52 Time-Span. P81b begin of the end: rdfs:Literal` (subPropertyOf `E52 Time-Span. P81 ongoing throughout: E61 Time Primitive`)\n\n> D2. addition of two new properties, defined as subproperties of `E52 Time-Span. P82 at some time within: E61 Time Primitive`, for the 'minimum outer bounds' specification of `E61 Time Primitive`.\n\nConsequently, we have created the following property definitions:\n\n- `E52 Time-Span. P82a begin of the begin: rdfs:Literal` (subPropertyOf `E52 Time-Span. P82 at some time within: E61 Time Primitive`)\n- `E52 Time-Span. P82b end of the end: rdfs:Literal` (subPropertyOf `E52 Time-Span. P82 at some time within: E61 Time Primitive`)\n\n> D3. addition of two new properties, defined as subproperties of `E54 Dimension. P90 has value: E60 Number`, for the upper and lower boundaries specification of `E60 Number`.\n\nConsequently, we have created the following property definitions:\n\n- `E54 Dimension. P90a has lower value limit: rdfs:Literal` (subPropertyOf `E54 Dimension. P90 has value: E60 Number`)\n- `E54 Dimension. P90b has upper value limit: rdfs:Literal` (subPropertyOf `E54 Dimension. P90 has value: E60 Number`)\n\n#### **E. Multiple ISA custom declaration Classes**\n\nThe following are declarations of frequently used multiple instantiations as classes with respective multiple IsA (so far only one):\n\n> E1. addition of a new class, defined as subClassOf `E41 Appellation` and `E33 Linguistic Object`, for all Appellations being regarded\nspecific to or characteristic for a language group and being described indirectly via a URI.\n\nAs a result, we have created the following class definition:\n\n- `E41_E33_Linguistic_Appellation` subClass of `E41_Appellation` and `E33_Linguistic_Object`\n\n#### **F. Translations and Scope notes**\n\n> F1. **Translations** Each RDFS Class or Property definition is accompanied by a set of translations expressed as rdfs:labels separated by xml:lang tags. The translation label used for each language is **the most recent** still **valid** translation. Still valid translation may be interpreted in the following ways:\n\n- The English label of the `CurrentVersion` that the current RDFS file is referring to is *almost equal* (accepting only differences regarding multiple spaces) to the English label of the `TranslationVersion` that the translated label was created for. For example, in order to accept a translation for `E22 Human-Made Object` in the CurrentVersion (7.1.1) we should have a translation for E22 that was created based on a CIDOC version that used the same name for E22. The class name of E22 was changed from `E22 Man-Made Object` to `E22 Human-Made Object` in version 6.2.7. So the only **valid** translations would be these that were created based on version 6.2.7 or later. Currently no such translation has been created, so `E22 Human-Made Object` in CurrentVersion (7.1.1) does not define any translation in the RDFS file.\n\n- Another option is to qualify translations as **valid** based on the scope note comparison of `CurrentVersion` and `TranslationVersion`. Since scope notes include formatting information, the comparison should ignore formatting changes.\n\nCurrently in this version we follow the option to qualify translations as valid based on the comparison of the respective labels in the corresponding CIDOC versions.\n\n> F2. **Scope notes** are defined as rdfs:comment and include only the text of the official CIDOC-CRM version in English language. Since scope notes are not just simple texts but include formatting data, a simple removal of the formatting data does not always produce a readable format. Therefore we followed the below simple conventions for the transformation of CIDOC-CRM scope note text into a readable rdfs:comment:\n\n- Each Paragraph defines a new line\n- Each element in an unordered list defines a new line\n- Each element in an ordered list defines a new line prefixed with `'{order}. '`\n- Each superscript text is separated from its base with `'-'`\n- Each subscript text is separated from its base with `'_'` (none found)\n\n> F3. **Scope notes of Inverse Properties**. Scope notes for the inverse/backwards direction of properties are not defined as they are covered by the definition of the direct/forward direction definition. Whenever the direct/forward property direction of a property `Pxxx` is not defined due to policy **B1**, then its scope note is used as scope note for the inverse/backwards property `Pxxxi`, and labeled as `Scope note for 'Pxxx':`.\n\nAs a result, the direct/forward property definition was used for the rdfs:comment definition of\n\n- `E92 Spacetime Volume. P169i spacetime volume is defined by: rdfs:Literal`\n- `E52 Time-Span. P170i time is defined by: rdfs:Literal`\n",

          "rdfs:comment": "This class comprises sets of coherent phenomena or cultural manifestations occurring in time and space.\nIt is the social or physical coherence of these phenomena that identify an instance of E4 Period and not the associated spatiotemporal extent. This extent is only the \u201Cground\u201D or space in an abstract physical sense that the actual process of growth, spread and retreat has covered. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area and time as a sedentary culture. This also means that overlapping land use rights, common among first nations, amounts to overlapping periods.\nOften, this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the \u201CNeolithic Period\u201D, the \u201CMing Dynasty\u201D or the \u201CMcCarthy Era\u201D, but also geopolitical units and activities of settlements are regarded as special cases of E4 Period. However, there are no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore, E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical birth, an instance of E67 Birth, can be seen as both a single event, i.e., an instance of E5 Event, and as an extended period, i.e., an instance of E4 Period, that consists of multiple physical processes and complementary activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor.\nAs the actual extent of an instance of E4 Period in spacetime we regard the trajectories of the participating physical things during their participation in an instance of E4 Period. This includes the open spaces via which these things have interacted and the spaces by which they had the potential to interact during that period or event in the way defined by the type of the respective period or event. Examples include the air in a meeting room transferring the voices of the participants. Since these phenomena are fuzzy, we assume the spatiotemporal extent to be contiguous, except for cases of phenomena spreading out over islands or other separated areas, including geopolitical units distributed over disconnected areas such as islands or colonies.\nWhether the trajectories necessary for participants to travel between these areas are regarded as part of the spatiotemporal extent or not has to be decided in each case based on a concrete analysis, taking use of the sea for other purposes than travel, such as fishing, into consideration. One may also argue that the activities to govern disconnected areas imply travelling through spaces connecting them and that these areas hence are spatially connected in a way, but it appears counterintuitive to consider for instance travel routes in international waters as extensions of geopolitical units.\nConsequently, an instance of E4 Period may occupy a number of disjoint spacetime volumes, however there must not be a discontinuity in the timespan covered by these spacetime volumes. This means that an instance of E4 Period must be contiguous in time. If it has ended in all areas, it has ended as a whole. However, it may end in one area before another, such as in the Polynesian migration, and it continues as long as it is ongoing in at least one area.\nWe model E4 Period as a subclass of E2 Temporal Entity and of E92 Spacetime Volume. The latter is intended as a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CIDOC CRMgeo (Doerr & Hiebel, 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance, we can discuss the physical extent of an instance of E4 Period without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated spacetime volume. This model combines two quite different kinds of substance: an instance of E4 Period is a phenomenon while an instance of E92 Spacetime Volume is an aggregation of points in spacetime. However, the real spatiotemporal extent of an instance of E4 Period is regarded to be unique to it due to all its details and fuzziness; its identity and existence depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E4 Period. Therefore, this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language.\nTypical use of this class in cultural heritage documentation is for documenting cultural and artistic periods. There are two different conceptualisations of \u2018artistic style\u2019, defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, \u201CImpressionism\u201D can be viewed as a period in the European sphere of influence lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an instance of E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.\nA geopolitical unit as a specific case of an instance of E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena related to the claim of power, the consequences of belonging to a jurisdictional area and an administrative system that establishes a geopolitical unit. Examples from the modern period are countries or administrative areas of countries such as districts whose actions and structures define activities and phenomena in the area that they intend to govern. The borders of geopolitical units are often defined in contracts or treaties although they may deviate from the actual practice. The spatiotemporal properties of Geopolitical units can be modelled through the properties inherited from E92 Spacetime Volume.\nAnother specific case of an instance of E4 Period is the actual extent of the set of activities and phenomena as evidenced by their physical traces that define a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.",

Typical examples are meetings, births, deaths, actions of decision taking, making or inventing things, but also more complex and extended ones such as conferences, elections, building of a castle, or battles.\nWhile the continuous growth of a tree lacks the limits characteristic of an event, its germination from a seed does qualify as an event. Similarly, the blowing of the wind lacks the distinctness and limits of an event, but a hurricane, flood or earthquake would qualify as an event. Mental processes are considered as events, in cases where they are connected with the material externalization of their results; for example, the creation of a poem, a performance or a change of intention that becomes obvious from subsequent actions or declarations.\nThe effects of an instance of E5 Event may not lead to relevant permanent changes of properties or relations of the items involved in it, for example an unrecorded performance. Of course, in order to be documented, some kind of evidence for an event must exist, be it witnesses, traces or products of the event.\nWhile instances of E4 Period always require some form of coherence between its constituent phenomena, in addition, the essential constituents of instances of E5 Event should contribute to an overall effect; for example, the statements made during a meeting and the listening of the audience.\nViewed at a coarse level of detail, an instance of E5 Event may appear as if it had an \u2018instantaneous\u2019 overall effect, but any process or interaction of material nature in reality have an extent in time and space. At a fine level, instances of E5 Event may be analyzed into component phenomena and phases within a space and timeframe, and as such can be seen as a period, regardless of the size of the phenomena. The reverse is not necessarily the case: not all instances of E4 Period give rise to a noteworthy overall effect and are thus not instances of E5 Event.",

The decision as to whether or not an object is regarded as new is context sensitive. Normally, items are considered \u201Cnew\u201D if there is no obvious overall similarity between them and the consumed items and material used in their production. In other cases, an item is considered \u201Cnew\u201D because it becomes relevant to documentation by a modification. For example, the scribbling of a name on a potsherd may make it a voting token. The original potsherd may not be worth documenting, in contrast to the inscribed one.\nThis entity can be collective: the printing of a thousand books, for example, would normally be considered a single event.\nAn event should also be documented using an instance of E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the originals. In this case, the new items have separate identities and matter is preserved, but identity is not.",

The type of the property asserted to hold between two items or concepts can be described by the property P177 assigned property type: E55 Type.\nFor example, the class describes the actions of people making propositions and statements during certain scientific/scholarly procedures, e.g., the person and date when a condition statement was made, an identifier was assigned, the museum object was measured, etc. Which kinds of such assignments and statements need to be documented explicitly in structures of a schema rather than free text, depends on whether this information should be accessible by structured queries.\nThis class allows for the documentation of how the respective assignment came about, and whose opinion it was. Note that all instances of properties described in a knowledge base are the opinion of someone. Per default, they are the opinion of the team maintaining the knowledge base. This fact must not individually be registered for all instances of properties provided by the maintaining team, because it would result in an endless recursion of whose opinion was the description of an opinion. Therefore, the use of instances of E13 Attribute Assignment marks the fact, that the maintaining team is in general neutral to the validity of the respective assertion, but registers someone else\u2019s opinion and how it came about.\nAll properties assigned in such an action can also be seen as directly relating the respective pair of items or concepts. Multiple use of instances of E13 Attribute Assignment may possibly lead to a collection of contradictory values.\nAll cases of properties in this model that are also described indirectly through a subclass of E13 Attribute Assignment are characterised as \"short cuts\" of a path via this subclass. This redundant modelling of two alternative views is preferred because many implementations may have good reasons to model either the action of assertion or the short cut, and the relation between both alternatives can be captured by simple rules.",

The interest is in the method and care applied, so that the reliability of the result may be judged at a later stage, or research continued on the associated documents. The date of the event is important for dimensions, which may change value over time, such as the length of an object subject to shrinkage. Methods and devices employed should be associated with instances of E16 Measurement by properties such as P33 used specific technique: E29 Design or Procedure, P125 used object of type: E55 Type, P16 used specific object (was used for): E70 Thing, whereas basic techniques such as \"carbon 14 dating\" should be encoded using P2 has type (is type of): E55 Type. Details of methods and devices reused or reusable in other instances of E16 Measurement should be documented for these entities rather than the measurements themselves, whereas details of particular execution may be documented by free text or by instantiating adequate sub-activities, if the detail may be of interest for an overarching query.\nRegardless whether a measurement is made by an instrument or by human senses, it represents the initial transition from physical reality to information without any other documented information object in between within the reasoning chain that would represent the result of the interaction of the observer or device with reality. Therefore, determining properties of an instance of E90 Symbolic Object is regarded as an instance of E13 Attribute Assignment, which may be inferred from observing and measuring representative carriers. In the case that the carrier can be named, the property P16 used specific object (was used for): should be used to indicate the instance(s) of E18 Physical Thing that was used as the empirical basis for the attribute assignment. For instance, inferring properties of depicted items using image material, such as satellite images, is not regarded as an instance of E16 Measurement, but as a subsequent instance of E13 Attribute Assignment. Rather, only the production of the images, understood as arrays of radiation intensities, is regarded as an instance of E16 Measurement. The same reasoning holds for other sensor data.",

In the wider sense, they are portions of particular objects with partially imaginary borders, such as the core of the Earth, an area of property on the surface of the Earth, a landscape or the head of a contiguous marble statue. They can be measured and dated, and it is sometimes possible to state who or what is or was responsible for them.

They do not convey any meaning other than a positioning on the \u201Ctime-line\u201D of chronology. The actual extent of an instance of E52 Time-Span can be approximated by properties of E52 Time-Span giving inner and outer bounds in the form of dates (instances of E61 Time Primitive). Comparing knowledge about time-spans is fundamental for chronological reasoning.\nSome instances of E52 Time-Span may be defined as the actual, in principle observable, temporal extent of instances of E2 Temporal Entity via the property P4 has time-span (is time-span of): E52 Time-Span. They constitute phenomenal time-spans as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr & Hiebel 2013). Since our knowledge of history is imperfect and physical phenomena are fuzzy in nature, the extent of phenomenal time-spans can only be described in approximation. An extreme case of approximation, might, for example, define an instance of E52 Time-Span having unknown beginning, end and duration. It may, nevertheless, be associated with other descriptions by which we can infer knowledge about it, such as in relative chronologies.\nSome instances of E52 may be defined precisely as representing a declaration of a temporal extent, as, for instance, done in a business contract. They constitute declarative time-spans as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr & Hiebel 2013) and can be described via the property E61 Time Primitive P170 defines time (time is defined by): E52 Time-Span.\nWhen used as a common E52 Time-Span for two events, it will nevertheless describe them as being simultaneous, even if nothing else is known.",

A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame.\nIt is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, we are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object \u2013 H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.\nAny instance of E18 Physical Thing can serve as a frame of reference for an instance of E53 Place.

The identity of an instance of E54 Dimension depends on the method of its determination because each method may produce different values even when determining comparable qualities. For instance, the wingspan of a bird alive or dead is a different dimension. Thermoluninescence dating and Rehydroxylation [RHX] dating are different dimensions of temporal distance from now, even if they aim at dating the same object. The method of determination should be expressed using the property P2 has type (is type of). Note that simple terms such as \u201Cdiameter\u201D or \u201Clength\u201D are normally insufficient to unambiguously describe a respective dimension. In contrast, \u201Cmaximum linear extent\u201D may be sufficient.\nThe properties of the class E54 Dimension allow for expressing the numerical approximation of the values of instances of E54 Dimension adequate to the precision of the applied method of determination. If the respective quantity belongs to a non-discrete space according to the laws of physics, such as spatial distances, it is recommended to record them as approximations by intervals or regions of indeterminacy enclosing the assumed true values. For instance, a length of 5 cm may be recorded as 4.5-5.5 cm, according to the precision of the respective observation. Note, that comparability of values described in different units depends critically on the representation as value regions.\nNumerical approximations in archaic instances of E58 Measurement Unit used in historical records should be preserved. Equivalents corresponding to current knowledge should be recorded as additional instances of E54 Dimension, as appropriate.",

Persistent Items may be physical entities, such as people, animals or things, conceptual entities such as ideas, concepts, products of the imagination or even names.\nInstances of E77 Persistent Item may be present or be part of interactions in different periods or events. They can repeatedly be recognized at disparate occasions during their existence by characteristics of structural nature. The respective characteristics need not be exactly the same during all the existence of an instance of E77 Persistent Item. Often, they undergo gradual change, still bearing some similarities with that of previous times, or disappear completely and new emerge. For instance, a person, from the time of being born on, will gradually change all its features and acquire new ones, such as a scar. Even the DNA in different body cells will develop defects and mutations. Nevertheless, relevant characteristics use to be sufficiently similar to recognize the instance for some substantial period of time.\nThe more specific criteria that determine the identity of instances of subclasses of E77 Persistent Item may vary considerably and are described of referred to in the respective scope notes. The decision about which exact criteria to use depends on whether the observable behaviour of the respective part of reality such confined conforms to the reasoning the user is interested in. For example, a building can be regarded as no longer existing if it is dismantled and the materials reused in a different configuration. On the other hand, human beings go through radical and profound changes during their life-span, affecting both material composition and form, yet preserve their identity by other criteria, such as being bodily separated from other persons. Similarly, inanimate objects may be subject to exchange of parts and matter. On the opposite, the identity of a (version of a) text of a scientific publication is given by the exact arrangement of its relevant symbols.\nThe main classes of objects that fall outside the scope of the E77 Persistent Item class are temporal objects such as periods, events and acts, and descriptive properties.\nAn instance of E77 Persistent Item does not require actual knowledge of the identifying features of the instance being currently known. There may be cases, where the actual identifying features of an instance of E77 Persistent Item are not decidable at a particular state of knowledge.",

Instances of E81 Transformation are therefore distinct from re-classifications (documented using E17 Type Assignment) or modifications (documented using E11 Modification) of objects that do not fundamentally change their nature or identity. Characteristic cases are reconstructions and repurposing of historical buildings or ruins, fires leaving buildings in ruins, taxidermy of specimen in natural history.\nEven though such instances of E81 Transformation are often motivated by a change of intended use, substantial material changes should justify the documentation of the result as a new instance of E18 Physical Thing and not just the change of function.

Respective phenomena may, for instance, be historical events or periods, but can also be the diachronic extent and existence of physical things. In other words, instances of this class fix a slice of another instance of E92 Spacetime Volume in time.\nThe temporal extent of an instance of E93 Presence typically is predetermined by the researcher so as to focus the investigation particularly on finding the spatial extent of the phenomenon by testing for its characteristic features. There are at least two basic directions such investigations might take. The investigation may wish to determine where something was during some time or it may wish to reconstruct the total passage of a phenomenon\u2019s spacetime volume through an examination of discrete presences. Observation and measurement of features indicating the presence or absence of a phenomenon in some space allows for the progressive approximation of spatial extents through argumentation typically based on inclusion, exclusion and various overlaps.",

An instance of E96 Purchase begins with the contract or equivalent agreement and ends with the fulfilment of all contractual obligations. In the case that the activity is abandoned before both parties have fulfilled these obligations, the activity is not regarded as an instance of E96 Purchase.\nThis class is a very specific case of the much more complex social business practices of exchange of goods and the creation and satisfaction of related social obligations.

The product type is the intended ideal form of the manufacture process. It is typical of instances of E22 that conform to an instance of E99 Product Type that its component parts are interchangeable with component parts of other instances of E22 made after the model of the same instance of E99. Frequently, the uniform production according to a given instance of E99 Product Type is achieved by creating individual tools, such as moulds or print plates that are themselves carriers of the design of the product type. Modern tools may use the flexibility of electronically controlled devices to achieve such uniformity. The product type itself, i.e., the potentially unlimited series of aesthetically equivalent items, may be the target of artistic design, rather than the individual object. In extreme cases, only one instance of a product type may have been produced, such as in a \"print on demand\" process which was only triggered once.

For example, the period \u201CRévolution française\u201D can be said to have taken place in \u201CFrance in 1789\u201D; the \u201CVictorian\u201D period may be said to have taken place in \u201CBritain from 1837-1901\u201D and its colonies, as well as other parts of Europe and North America. An instance of E4 Period can take place at multiple non-contiguous, non-overlapping locations.\nThis property is a shortcut of the more fully developed path from E4 Period through P161 has spatial projection, E53 Place, P89 falls within to E53 Place. E4 Period is a subclass of E92 Spacetime Volume. By the definition of P161 has spatial projection an instance of E4 Period takes place on all its spatial projections, that is, instances of E53 Place. Something happening at a given place can also be considered to happen at a larger place containing the first. For example, the assault on the Bastille July 14th 1789 took place in the area covered by Paris in 1789 but also in the area covered by France in 1789.",

The spatial extent of the composing part is included in the spatial extent of the whole.\nComponent elements, since they are themselves instances of E18 Physical Thing, may be further analysed into sub-components, thereby creating a hierarchy of part decomposition. An instance of E18 Physical Thing may be shared between multiple wholes, for example two buildings may share a common wall. This property does not specify when and for how long a component element resided in the respective whole. If a component is not part of a whole from the beginning of existence or until the end of existence of the whole, the classes E79 Part Addition and E90 Part Removal can be used to document when a component became part of a particular whole and/or when it stopped being a part of it. For the time-span of being part of the respective whole, the component is completely contained in the place the whole occupies.\nThis property is intended to describe specific components that are individually documented, rather than general aspects. Overall descriptions of the structure of an instance of E18 Physical Thing are captured by the P3 has note property.\nThe instances of E57 Material of which an instance of E18 Physical Thing is composed should be documented using P45 consists of (is incorporated in).\nThis property is transitive and non-reflexive",

An instance of E36 Visual Item identifies a recognisable image or visual symbol, regardless of what this image may or may not represent.\nFor example, all recent British coins bear a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, a fact that is correctly documented using P62 depicts (is depicted by). Different portraits have been used at different periods, however. P65 shows visual item (is shown by) can be used to refer to a particular portrait.\nP65 shows visual item (is shown by) may also be used for Visual Items such as signs, marks and symbols, for example the 'Maltese Cross' or the 'copyright symbol\u2019 that have no particular representational content.\nThis property is part of the fully developed path E24 Physical Human-Made Thing, P65 shows visual item, E36 Visual Item, P138 represents to E1 CRM Entity which is shortcut by, P62 depicts (is depicted by).",

This property allows a Time-Span\u2019s minimum temporal extent (i.e., its inner boundary) to be assigned an E61 Time Primitive value. Time Primitives are treated by the CIDOC CRM as application or system specific date intervals, and are not further analysed.

Since Time-Spans may not have precisely known temporal extents, the CIDOC CRM supports statements about the minimum and maximum temporal extents of Time-Spans. This property allows a Time-Span\u2019s maximum temporal extent (i.e., its outer boundary) to be assigned an E61 Time Primitive value. Time Primitives are treated by the CIDOC CRM as application or system specific date intervals, and are not further analysed. If different sources of evidence justify different maximum extents without contradicting each other, the resulting intersection of all these extents will be the best estimate. This should be taken into account for information integration.",

The property can also be used to express similarity in cases that can be stated between two objects only, without historical knowledge about its reasons. The property expresses a symmetric relationship in case no direction of influence can be established either from evidence on the item itself or from historical knowledge. This holds in particular for siblings of a derivation process from a common source or non-causal cultural parallels, such as some weaving patterns.\nThe P130.1 kind of similarity property of the P130 shows features of (features are also found on) property enables the relationship between the domain and the range to be further clarified, in the sense from domain to range, if applicable. For example, it may be expressed if both items are product \u201Cof the same mould\u201D, or if two texts \u201Ccontain identical paragraphs\u201D.\nIf the reason for similarity is a sort of derivation process, i.e., that the creator has used or had in mind the form of a particular thing during the creation or production, this process should be explicitly modelled. In these cases, P130 shows features of can be regarded as a shortcut of such a process. However, the current model does not contain any path specific enough to infer this property. Specializations of the CIDOC CRM may however be more explicit, for instance describing the use of moulds etc.\nThis property is not transitive.",

This allows for describing the thing itself as a place that may contain other things, such as a box that may contain coins. In other words, it is the volume that contains all the points which the thing has covered at some time during its existence. The reference space for the associated place must be the one that is permanently at rest (P157 is at rest relative to) relative to the physical thing. For instances of E19 Physical Objects it is the one which is at rest relative to the object itself, i.e., which moves together with the object. For instances of E26 Physical Feature it is one which is at rest relative to the physical feature itself and the surrounding matter immediately connected to it. Therefore, there is a 1:1 relation between the instance E18 Physical Thing and the instance of E53 Place it occupies. We include in the occupied space the space filled by the matter of the physical thing and all its inner spaces.\nThis property implies the fully developed path from E18 Physical Thing through P196 defines, E92 Spacetime Volume, P161 has spatial projection to E53 Place. However, in contrast to P156 occupies, the property P161 has spatial projection does not constrain the reference space of the referred instance of E53 Place.\nIn contrast to P156 occupies, for the property P53 has former or current location the following holds:\nIt does not constrain the reference space of the referred instance of E53 Place.\nIt identifies a possibly wider instance of E53 Place at which a thing is or has been for some unspecified time span.\nIf the reference space of the referred instance of E53 Place is not at rest with respect to the physical thing found there, the physical thing may move away after some time to another place and/or may have been at some other place before. The same holds for the fully developed path from E18 Physical Thing through P196 defines, E92 Spacetime Volume, P161 has spatial projection to E53 Place.",

Thus, it can be seen that the projection is not unique.\nThe spatial projection is the actual spatial coverage of a spacetime volume, which normally has fuzzy boundaries except for instances of E92 Spacetime Volumes which are geometrically defined in the same reference system as the range of this property are an exception to this and do not have fuzzy boundaries. Modelling explicitly fuzzy spatial projections serves therefore as a common topological reference of different spatial approximations rather than absolute geometric determination, for instance for relating outer or inner spatial boundaries for the respective spacetime volumes.\nIn case the domain of an instance of P161 has spatial projection is an instance of E4 Period, the spatial projection describes all areas that period was ever present at, for instance, the Roman Empire.\nThis property is part of the fully developed path from E18 Physical Thing through P196 defines, E92 Spacetime Volume, P161 has spatial projection to E53 Place, which in turn is implied by P156 occupies (is occupied by).\nThis property is part of the fully developed path from E4 Period through P161 has spatial projection, E53 Place, P89 falls within (contains) to E53 Place, which in turn is shortcut by P7 took place at (witnessed).",

The property does not necessarily state the quality or accuracy of this approximation, but rather indicates the use of the first instance of place to approximate the second.\nIn common documentation practice, find or encounter spots e.g., in archaeology, botany or zoology are often related to the closest village, river or other named place without detailing the relation, e.g., if it is located within the village or in a certain distance of the specified place. In this case the stated \u201Cphenomenal\u201D place found in the documentation can be seen as approximation of the actual encounter spot without more specific knowledge.\nIn more recent documentation often point coordinate information is provided that originates from GPS measurements or georeferencing from a map. This point coordinate information does not state the actual place of the encounter spot but tries to approximate it with a \u201Cdeclarative\u201D place. The accuracy depends on the methodology used when creating the coordinates. It may be dependent on technical limitations like GPS accuracy but also on the method where the GPS location is taken in relation to the measured feature. If the methodology is known a maximum deviation from the measured point can be calculated and the encounter spot or feature may be related to the resulting circle using an instance of P171 at some place within.\nThis property is not transitive.",
